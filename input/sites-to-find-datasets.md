Datasets are the backbone of any programmatic SEO project, but finding high-quality datasets can be a challenge in itself. No matter how efficient the popular search engines are, they can’t always find what you’re looking for.

A while ago, I was searching for a dataset for a project but couldn’t find it anywhere. So, I outsourced everything to a freelance scraper, but a week later, I found the exact dataset on a website.

What a waste of money!

And then I got the idea to find and collect all the well-known as well as hidden sources of datasets that can be useful for programmatic SEO projects. Because the more time you spend on finding the perfect dataset, the better will be the quality of generated pages.

Let’s take a look…

## Cool places to find datasets for pSEO

I will list out all the well-known as well as lesser-known sites that are extremely helpful for finding datasets. I have personally used most of these sites for my projects.

And if you are looking for useful datasets in different niches, I have created a section where I manually curate useful datasets by niches – visit datasets for programmatic SEO section.

I will keep adding more and more sites to list as I explore. Meanwhile, if you know a site that has some good datasets available, kindly let me know in the comments and I will add it to the list.
