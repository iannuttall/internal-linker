Critics of programmatic SEO often claim that it results in poor-quality content, however, it's important to note that human writers can also create low-quality content. The same way not all content created by humans is high-quality, not all content created using programmatic methods is low-quality.

Programmatic SEO is around for at least a decade and people have been successfully using it to create user-friendly pages, but you will come across several instances where someone will be calling pSEO as low-quality, marketing gimmick, and even spam.

But I assure you that **programmatic SEO is anything but spam**. And whoever disagrees with it, I would say that they don’t thoroughly understand the concept.

## Understanding programmatic SEO (with an example)

If the webpage for `nutrition facts of apples` is designed as shown in the picture below, won’t you want `nutrition facts of oranges` and `nutrition facts of strawberries` to be in the same format?

And if you do prefer the same design and format for all these “nutrition facts” pages, you can (and should) use programmatic SEO. By using the technique, you can create a template and then connect your template to a database via an automation program to dynamically create multiple pages at once.

**The benefits?**

- You spend less time publishing

- You can easily scale to 1000s of pages

- You have fewer chances of errors in the data

- You drive more people to your website

And ultimately more revenue for your business!

See! No spam!!

> In the spam content policies, Google clarifies that not all types of automatically-generated content are spam. Only the content that doesn’t provide anything original or doesn’t add sufficient value is considered spam.

## Final words

**No, programmatic SEO cannot be considered spam**. It can only be considered a robust content strategy that improves user experience and increases revenue.
